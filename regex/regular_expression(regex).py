Wild card characters

-> The dot character matches any character
-> if we add the asterisk character, the character is "any number of times"

-> ^X.*:
^ - matches the start of the line
. - matches any character
* - many times
: - matches colon too

-> ^X-\S+:
matches - X-................:
\S - match any non-whitespace character
+ - one or more times

example: does not match to following sentance due to space
'X-Place is behind schedule'


^  - matches the beginning of a line w
$  - matches the end of a line
.  - matches any character
\s - matches whitespace
\S - matches any non-whitespace character
*  - Repeats a character zero or more times
*? - Repeats a character zero or more times (Non-greedy)
+  - Repeats a character one or more times
+? - Repeats a character one or more times (Non-greedy)
[aeiou] - Matches a single character in the listed set
[^XYZ]  - Matches a single not in the listed set
[a-z0-9] - The set of characters can include a range
(   - indicates where string extraction is to start    
)   - Indicates where string extraction is to end.

'''
-> re.search() returns a True/False depending on weather the string matches 
   the regular expression

-> to extract the matching string, use re.findall()


[0-9]+
-> above statement will look for one or more digits
