'''
This code checks wheather given number is prime or not, but this is an optimized program. Rather than,
iterating over numbers till given value we use 6k+-1 method.

This code is taken from : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-to-check-whether-a-number-is-prime-or-not/

We can do the following optimizations: 
* Instead of checking till n, we can check till √n because a larger factor of n
  must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has been already checked.

* The algorithm can be improved further by observing that all primes are of the form 6k ± 1, 
  with the exception of 2 and 3. This is because all integers can be expressed as (6k + i)
  for some integer k and for i = ?1, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4; 2 divides (6k + 0), (6k + 2), (6k + 4);
  and 3 divides (6k + 3). So a more efficient method is to test if n is divisible by 2 or 3,
  then to check through all the numbers of form 6k ± 1.
