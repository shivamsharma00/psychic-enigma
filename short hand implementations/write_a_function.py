'''
In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

    The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
        The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
            The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
